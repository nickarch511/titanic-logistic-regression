# titanic-logistic-regression
In this project, I experiment with building a logistic regression model to predict whether a person aboard the titanic survived. 

This is my very first data science project, so expect it to be a little elementary, but as I progress I hope to work on more advanced projects.

There were many different fields provided with information on each passenger. I decided to scrap certain fields that might not be of use. The model
ended up with around 67.6% accuracy. Areas of improvement could include experimenting with some of the fields I dropped, more data visualizations, and 
limiting the number of entries that were dropped (I decided to drop all entries whose cabin numbers were not listed, this eliminated a large portion of the data set)
